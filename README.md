# OpenType Practice
This is a short exercise to practice implementing advanced typography features.

In this exercise you'll practice:
- Using third party font services (Adobe Fonts) including different weights and styles
- Using compound class selectors and descendant combinator selectors
- Implementing and changing OpenType Features

_Tip: remember that when using a third-party font service you need to set the font-family, font-weight, and font-style (which are all separate CSS properties)_

## Tasks
- Create a "Web Project" in Adobe Fonts/Typekit that includes:
  - "Mr Eaves San" Book, Book Italic and Bold
  - "Mrs Eaves XL Serif" Regular, Regular Italic
- Embed the "web project" stylesheet in your HTML file
- Set the default font to be "Mrs Eaves XL Serif" regular. Use Georgia as the backup web-safe font.
  - Turn on ligatures and old style figures by default
- Set "Mr Eaves San" Book to be the default heading font. Use Verdana as the backup web-safe font. Turn off the ligatures and old style figures and turn on lining figures.
- By default the emphasis tag is italic. Change the font-style to be normal and turn on small caps.
- Change the weight of the "example" class to be the bold version of "Mr Eaves San"
- Publish the site live and submit URL on Blackboard
